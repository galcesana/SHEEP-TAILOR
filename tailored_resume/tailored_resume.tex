% Summary Section
\section*{Summary}
Highly motivated and detail-oriented third-year Computer Science student at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem seeking a student R\&D position in software development. Possessing a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software development, I am proficient in Python, C++, Java, and SQL.  I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to contribute to impactful projects, particularly those involving machine learning and data analysis.  My experience as a Data Annotator at SAIPS has provided me with hands-on experience in developing and using data annotation tools for training neural network models for autonomous vehicle systems.
